# Playwright TestNG Framework Commands
# Use these Maven commands to run tests and generate Allure reports.
# Run from the project root: D:\Projects\java-projects\test-framework-playwright (Windows) or equivalent (macOS/Linux).
# Ensure setup.ps1 (Windows) or setup.sh (macOS/Linux) has been run to install Maven and Allure.

# Run tests for any group (e.g., navigation, form)
mvn clean test -Dgroups=<group>
# Example:
mvn clean test -Dgroups=ui
mvn clean test -Dgroups=api

# Run tests using testng.xml (default: ui and elements groups, excludes regression)
mvn clean test

# Generate and serve Allure report (after running tests)
allure serve target/allure-results

# Clean project (remove target/ directory)
mvn clean
